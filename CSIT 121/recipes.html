<h1>Pozole</h1>
<h2>My Favorite Recipe</h2>
<p>Pozole is a soup or stew that is typically made with pork, hominy, and chili peppers. It is a dish that is traditionally eaten in Mexico and has a long history dating back to the Aztec people.</p>

<p>There are many different ways to make pozole, but my favorite recipe is a bit simpler and uses only a few ingredients.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>1 lb. of pork shoulder</li>
 <li>1 can of hominy</li>
 <li>1 small can of green chilies</li>
 <li>1 onion</li>
 <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
 <li>1 tsp. of cumin</li>
 <li>1 tsp. of chili powder</li>
 <li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
 <li>To make the soup, start by browning the pork in a large pot or Dutch oven.</li>
 <li>Once the pork is browned, add the hominy, green chilies, onion, garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper. Add enough water to cover the ingredients.</li>
 <li>Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 1-2 hours.</li>
 <li>Serve the soup with some chopped onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Enjoy!</li>
