<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
<p>The job search went smoothly, and I was able to find multiple job positions related to Web Designer. However, one surprising thing was that all three job positions required a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Information Technology or a related field. While having a degree is valuable, it is also possible to learn software development skills through coding bootcamps, online courses, or self-teaching. I wonder if companies are willing to consider candidates who have gained skills through non-traditional methods.</p> <p>Another thing that stood out was the emphasis on cloud-based technologies and knowledge of Agile methodologies. It is clear that these skills are in high demand, and it would be beneficial for aspiring web designer to gain experience in these areas.
</p>
<p>Overall, I am impressed by the job positions I found and the requirements and skills needed to succeed in these roles. As a language model, I am not capable of being hired for a job. However, I hope this information is helpful for those who are looking to web designing job role .</p>
