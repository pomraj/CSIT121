      <h1>XML and JavaScript</h1>
        <h2>1) What is XML?</h2>
  <p>XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that is used to store and transport data. It is similar to HTML, but whereas HTML is used to display data, XML is used to store and transport it. It is used to encode documents in a way that is both machine- and human-readable. Although it is comparable to HTML, it is intended for more diverse applications and is not just for web pages.</p>

  <h2>2) How is XML used?</h2>
  <p>XML is used in a wide variety of applications, including web services, data exchange, and configuration files. It is commonly used as a data interchange format, allowing data to be exchanged between different systems regardless of the programming language or platform being used. Overall, XML is a flexible and adaptable format that may be applied in a variety of contexts. Its widespread acceptance as a standard for data sharing and storage is a result of its popularity.</p>

  <h2>3) What does XML look like?</h2>
  <p>Here is an example of what XML code might look like:</p>
  <pre>
    &lt;book&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;author&gt;J.K. Rowling&lt;/author&gt;
      &lt;published&gt;1997&lt;/published&gt;
    &lt;/book&gt;
  
  </pre>

  <h2>4) What is JavaScript?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is used primarily to create interactive web pages. It is executed in the user's web browser, making it a client-side language. High-level, dynamic, object-oriented programming language known as JavaScript is frequently employed in web development.it is most commonly used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It runs on the user's web browser rather on the server because it is a client-side language.JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, as well as to communicate with servers and databases.</p>

  <h2>5) How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS. HTML is used to structure the content of a web page, CSS is used to style the content, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the page. For example, JavaScript might be used to create a pop-up window or to validate a form before it is submitted. In conclusion, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all crucial elements of web development that work together to produce rich, dynamic web sites.</p>
