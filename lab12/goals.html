    <h3>Goals and Outcomes! </h3>
    <p>While I'm at Community College for my two-year degree, I want to make the most of the resources, expertise, and lecturers that are available. Because of the smaller class sizes, convenient location, and outstanding IT curriculum, Community College caught my eye while I was looking at colleges. I've had wonderful success in my classes thus far and have cherished the connections I've developed with both teachers and pupils. I'm eager to start the Information Technology program and am hoping that by doing so, I will start to advance my education and expertise. </p>
