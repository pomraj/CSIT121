    <h2>Work </h2>

    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>Spending time with my wife and family is the one thing I would rather do if I weren't working , class, or studying. We all enjoy each other's company and have a fantastic time, whether we are traveling briefly, seeing both of our families, or just spending the night indoors watching movies and playing games. They've all given me life lessons that have helped me get where I am now. I spending time with my family and couldn't imagine loving them more.

    <h2> Hobbies</h2>
    <p>We constantly embark on new adventures and pick up new hobbies, my wife and I included. There is no better place to be, in our opinion, than the outdoors. Rock climbing, hiking, scuba diving, fishing, swimming, mountain biking, hunting, fishing, rafting, etc. are all activities we enjoy. We always try to make the most of our time together! There is always so much you can learn about yourself in these environments, which is why I love being active outdoors and having hobbies.  </p>
